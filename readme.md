The script allows to sort photos and videos captured by iphone:
- it puts captured photos and videos into folders related to the file creation time
- it puts other media (other images e.g. recived by whatsapp in a separate folder)
This allows to quickly separate recorded media from other and manage it.

Before using the script, set the following variables:
source_path (str) - path to folder with media data
compare_dict (dict) - dictionary with properties based on which the separation is done
